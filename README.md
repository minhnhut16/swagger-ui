# Swagger UI demo

This repo is a demo to clone swagger file on repos that I can join at ts

## Set up

you can read my .env.sample to config .env file and run this react project with
### `yarn`
### `yarn start`

The Idea of this repo is:
- Get Information of the scanned repos in .env
- Get all blob swagger match the dirPath and regex in .env for every repo
- Use there blob swagger to a select UI => choose and display
